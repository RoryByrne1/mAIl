Dear Ali Raza,

We are getting in touch to make you aware that there is a loss of hot water and heating affecting Frances Gardner House. This means that there is no hot water coming out of the taps and showers and The heaters aren't providing heating.

The issue has been reported to contractors, and we are waiting for them to attend the site. We will keep you updated with progress.

In the interim, residents can use the two showers opposite the laundry room and can ask for portal heaters from the reception desk.

We apologise for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your patience and understanding while we resolve the issue.

If you have any queries or issues regarding this, please speak with the Hall Team at reception, phone +44 (0)20 7833 8175, or email langton.close@ucl.ac.uk. 

 

Kind Regards, 

Frances Gardner House
